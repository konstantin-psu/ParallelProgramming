{2..6} - two groups 2 3 and 4 5 6

you can have extra ind : 0 1 {2..6} 7
                         00   0   3  3 

Every domain has mapping
D = {1..n} by default all values mapped to locale 0
BD = D mapped(...) - user specified mapped provided for it

BD1 = BD  - does the domain map carry over - YES we only created an alias, and all the properties of BD carried over

BUT

BD2: domain(1) = BD -- is not the same as BD (map of bd is not inherited) this is a completely new object with sequential map
